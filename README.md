# panther_simulation
Simulation models for Panther (including Gazebo)

> **Warning**
>
> We have migrated the development of the `panther_simulation` package to the [panther_ros](https://github.com/husarion/panther_ros) repository. While the current ROS 2 version of the package is still available only in this repository, we want to inform you that we are actively working on adding the latest ROS 2 version to the new repository as well, but this process is not yet complete..
>
> For additional guidance on configuring the Panther robot and running demos, refer to the [panther-docker](https://github.com/husarion/panther-docker) repository or check out the manuals available on the official Husarion [website](https://husarion.com/manuals/panther/).

Available Docker images:
- [`panther-gazebo`](./panther_gazebo) for ROS Galactic.
